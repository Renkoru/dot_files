* Why Emacs
** Emacs is:
- Original extensible

* Good editor color scheme
** Points
1. *Dark* text on *light* background when we talking about *paragraphs* of text, that user going to *read*
2. *Light* text on *dark* background when we talking about *headings/titles/lables* of text, that user going to *scan*
