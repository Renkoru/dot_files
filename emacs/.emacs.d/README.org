** Emacs things to learn
- Hooks
  Add a hook for 'jump to definition' to make 'z t'(scroll line to top) after it
- [ ] Help functions in emacs
    - [ ] Make a list of all kinds of 'help' that emacs has
    - [ ] *C-h C-h* 'help-to-help'
    - [ ] *C-h k* help about command

** Important:
   - Nothing yet...

### Some scripts in work
(let (
    (myvar (split-string (magit-get-current-branch) "-"))
)
 (message (concat (nth 0 myvar) "-" (nth 1 myvar)))
)

* Why Emacs
** Emacs is:
- Original extensible
- Customizable
  - Change all key-bindings
- Self-documenting

* Articles
1. About why Vim. https://medium.com/@mkozlows/why-atom-cant-replace-vim-433852f4b4d1
* Good editor color scheme
** Points
1. *Dark* text on *light* background when we talking about *paragraphs* of text, that user going to *read*
2. *Light* text on *dark* background when we talking about *headings/titles/lables* of text, that user going to *scan*

* *Known Issues*
** No url found for submodule path 'v2/dashboard_project/src/python-instagram' in .gitmodules
Solution: Invoke next script in the shell
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  # find a submodule
  git ls-files --stage | grep 160000
  # remove it
  git rm --cached v2/dashboard_project/src/python-instagram
#+END_SRC
